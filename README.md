# Tuition-Website
 A full-stack website of a tuition agency that focuses on matching potential tutors to tutees. 

Tools I'll be using:
 - For the front-end, I'll be using HTML, CSS and JS.
 - For the back-end, I'll use Vue.js as the JS framework and Tailwind CSS as the CSS framework. I'll be using Express.js and SQLite as well.
 
 How the site works:
 1. Parents of such tutees can seek for the agency's help to search for potential tutors. 
 2. The agents in the agency will post a job assignment on the site on behalf of the parents.
 3. Hence, any interested tutors can apply for these assignments on the site.

 Site features:
 - Form feature: Users (Tutees' parents) can fill up a form to request for a tutor. 
 - Filter feature: Users (Tutors) can filter the assignments based on location, rates, subjects etc.
